# Code Sharing Strategy: An Overview

In my work with different companies, I’ve learned a lot about sharing code and building shared skills. I'd like to talk about how to organize work with shared code.

## What You'll Learn Here:
- Ways to handle code sharing in a company.
- Deciding who keeps the code up to date and puts it into action in teams.
- Important things to watch out for when making reusable code (and rules to follow).
- Managing shared code: One big library or many small ones?
- Code that shouldn't be shared.
- Why the Enabling Team's job is really important (and often missed) in a company?
- Possible downsides to this way of doing things.

## Introduction
